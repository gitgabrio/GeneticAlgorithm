# GeneticAlgorithm
This is a fork/extension of the original [GeneticAlgorithm](https://github.com/memento/GeneticAlgorithm).
Many thanks to Ms Vijini Mallawaarachchi ( [@Vini2](https://github.com/Vini2) ) and [@memento](https://github.com/memento) for their work.

While the original one was meant to be as easy as possible to be used by datascience reader, this one is targeting developers, and will use generally
agreed upon standards (maven management, external libraries, etc)

This repo focuses on :  
- Kotlin/Functional refactoring
- using it in almost-real use case
